                        <h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>
                        PLANTA corporate group is a full-service landscaper – from the
                        idea up to result. We create landscapes (in cooperation with our
                        clients), design, implement, and, if required, take care of our
                        creations.

                        Our company is one of the oldest on the Russian landscape market and one
                        of the biggest. In this case, size matters. All over the world,
                        multiple specialized companies are involved in landscape design: some of
                        them design, other – build, other – set plants, other – handle them.
                        However, on the Russian – still very young – landscape market it is much
                        more convenient, for a client in the first place, to delegate the whole
                        process to one reliable company. We go through all work stages and not
                        only release the client from problems, inevitable in work with multiple
                        contractors, but also can confidently give long-term guaranty for
                        everything we do.

                        <h3>WHAT WE DO</h3>
                        We are not afraid to say that we do everything related to
                        landscape architecture: we design objects for different purposes, of any
                        size and complexity, we build, plant, and maintain existing units.
                        In two decades, we have accumulated extensive experience in landscape
                        design and construction, as well as maintenance of existing units in
                        private and public territories, with areas from 0.5 up to 400 hectares,
                        in Russia and abroad.
                        Among other things, we specialize in creating control systems for
                        landscape improvement process in vast territories with long-term project
                        deadlines. We know the details in technology and logistics of landscape
                        design that often neglected by construction companies. According to our
                        (and worldwide) experience, the earlier landscaper is involved in the
                        process of complex units design – the easier it appears to save assets
                        efficiently, work faster and avoid errors and corrections.

                        <h3>HOW WE DO IT</h3>
                        We use wealthy global and personal experience in landscape
                        architecture, rest upon tradition and follow modern trends. We are
                        extremely style sensitive, which helps us create landscapes in various
                        styles – from classic to hi-tech.
                        Depending on a task, we use modern and traditional technologies and
                        materials and combine them.
                        We do not offer “typical” decisions. Our architects’ ideas and projects
                        are always individual and born in communication with a client. Attentive
                        to clients’ tastes and wishes, we never impose our viewpoint and try to
                        find a key to dialogue and mutual understanding.
